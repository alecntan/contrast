Hey!

My name is Alec Tan and I'm a Computer Science graduate from  the University of New South Wales Australia.
My love for programming has led me through some really cool experiences and some new set of skills. I've had the opportunity to be an intern for a [creative agency](https://www.instagram.com/dottystylecreative/) in the Philippines, and the privelage of bringing value to my fellow students at UNSW by helping build a [web app](https://freerooms.csesoc.app).

During my spare time, I like to explore interesting technologies and practice solving problems with code. I'm currently learning how to create web applications using TypeScript and the Spring Framework.

Outside of Software Engineering, I like to read sci-fi / fantasy novels, go fishing, and play some Warhammer 40k!
